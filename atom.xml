    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Saw octopress mentioned on HN, don&#8217;t really like tumblr so thought I&#8217;d try it.
Seems prety neat. Don&#8217;t expect github pages to go down and it&#8217;s just a git repo
so less effort to maintain it etc. Let&#8217;s give this blagging stuff a shot.</p>

<p>So&#8230; me. I play TF2 competitively, listen to tons of music, love reading,
enjoy starting projects as I get ideas and never finishing them, doi.
I&#8217;m graduating from IIT (as long as I survive number theory) and I&#8217;ve been
working at Backstop Solutions for about a year now. It&#8217;s been a great place
to learn and work. Whenever I&#8217;m in class I&#8217;m wishing I was at work instead.</p>

<p>I love Python, survive Java, tolerate Ruby, and try Clojure. Git is best
VCS and vim is best editor. My environment is Linux and my terminal is
guake (or anything quake styled). IntelliJ makes Java not a hair tearing
mess but I always wish I was in vim.</p>

<p>I want to improve my linuxfu, functional programming, and my TF2 prowess
(I wanna be Plat, mmmk). I keep messing with IRC bots and markov chains
and love dreaming up ideas. I have a resume in a repo (currently
not current, hah). I sometimes try my hand at art and it seems I&#8217;m ok at
pixel art.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not pro, but I&#8217;ll get there some day.</p>
